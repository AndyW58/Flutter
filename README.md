# Material Design 3 Unique Primary Colors

This Flutter App (main.dart) was created to walk through all 16,777,216 RBG color codes, apply each as a seed color to the Material Design 3 ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Color) function and determine the exact number of possible/available unique Primary colors.

A PDF file provides the list of Primary colors generated and sorted by hue.
